### Homeworks

#### The process

All homeworks live in the repo https://github.com/labs-ruby/homeworks-2021.
1) A student forks the repo and makes a PR into the homeworks/HW{number} with the folder named as his {name_surname}.
2) Also, a student must add a link to the PR in the specific block in **Journal**
3) A mentor looks at the **journal**, and if everything is OK merges and paints the block into green, or leaves some comments. All conversations within a PR are in English.
