### Homeworks

#### The process

All homeworks live in the repo https://github.com/labs-ruby/homeworks-2022.
1) A student forks the repo and makes a PR into the homeworks/HW{number} with the folder named as his {name_surname}.
2) Also, a student must add a link to the PR in the specific block in **Learning Path**
3) A mentor looks at the **learning path**, and if everything is OK merges and marks the task as completed, or leaves some comments in the PR itself. All conversations within a PR are in English.
