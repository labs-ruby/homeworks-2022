## HW04

- use `Ruby >= 3.0`
- please create fork from the https://github.com/labs-ruby/homeworks-2022 (should be
  already done)
- then create a new branch `my_hw_04`
- and go to the directory to `HW04`
- create a folder with your name `Name_Surname`
- you homeworks should be checked by `rubocop`. So, please 
  correct you code if there is a request from the rubocop (https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide).
  
### Tasks:

Your application should describe the interaction between students and mentors.
See [example of how it should look like](example.rb).

When you implement the classes structure, create an `app.rb` file where you will show the interactions between objects like in the example above.

Feel free to experiment!
